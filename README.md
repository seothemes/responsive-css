# Responsive CSS

This little plugin adds a new section to the Customizer which allows you to add CSS at different breakpoints without having to manually write media queries.

It creates the following custom CSS fields:

- All screen sizes
- Mobile only
- Desktop only

You can also change the breakpoint at which the mobile and desktop media queries change.
